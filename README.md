# MachineLearning
Exercises for Stanford's Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.

NOTE: All of the problems supplied by the course come pre=packaged with skeleton code that we must fill in to recieve credit. Often the sections we work on are blocked-off with comments but I have occasionally edited the skeleton code to help myself understand the subtleties of MATLAB.
